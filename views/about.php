?><p>As manager of an adult co-ed softball team, Mark Ross developed over the course of several seasons a spreadsheet
    to help him keep track of rosters and game lineups. Spreadsheets are boring, though, so he decided to recreate
    all the functions of a spreadsheet (and more) while learning some Web technologies. What you see is a
    result of that effort.</p>
